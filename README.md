# crunchlabs-worksheets
Worksheets to supplement crunchlab's subscription boxes to teach engineering and science to children

Currently all worksheets are being created via Google Docs.  But I'm 100% willing to move them to a markdown or asciidoc or latex or whatever processing language the community is most comfortable with!

You can find all worksheets I've created so far at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H3-q9c0UoBsvAlTNd_n9Nrg1gZB7bya8?usp=sharing
